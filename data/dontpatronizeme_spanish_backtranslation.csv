7419,@@23830603,vulnerable,on,"Dr. Mayengbam Lalit Singh Recently, the Hon'ble Prime Minister of India launched a plan called ""Doubling Farmers' Income"" to improve the welfare of a larger portion of Indians. The big questions that people feel are (i) How would it be possible in a short period of time? And (ii) is it an elusive doctrine to sweep the vote bank of millions of farmers for the upcoming parliamentary elections in 2019? Throughout India (except in a few states) many rigidities need to be resolved to increase the real income of farmers. These rigidities are characterized by infrastructures, structures and institutions. This article focuses on these rigidities only for Manipur, which has lagged behind many Indian states. In terms of infrastructure (inputs), the state lags behind among the backward states in India. Looking at water infrastructure, the state has been underutilizing water resources despite abundant availability. For Kharif season crops, farmers rely on rainwater as the state lies under the SE monsoon map. However, during the Rabi and Zayed seasons, the state has witnessed water shortages. To curb this shortage, the government needs to build multiple check dams and dig wells in those small streams that flow through the flat areas. During the high season, there is always a shortage of fertilizers and pesticides due to landslides on national highways. The organic agriculture revolution will decrease the dependence on chemical fertilizers as the state has a high potential to produce organic fertilizers and pesticides. During the post-harvest period, the state needs to build cold storage so perishable crops can be stored for off-season farming seasons. Regarding financial support to agriculture, the banks are not integrated with the farmers. Also, the state government does not organize crop insurance schemes to compensate for losses due to natural calamities. My previous article on ""Channeling the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA) with Crop and Livestock Insurance in India"" posits the model on how to make up for the loss. The second rigid character of agriculture is that there have been no structural changes for decades. Agriculture in Manipur focuses on the production of coarse grains only, which is characterized by immediate consumption. In this era of globalization, agriculture must have a close insight into the supply and demand pattern of consumers around the world. Especially in mountainous areas, coarse grain cultivation is only for local consumption and not for profit. Nowadays, farmers declare the cultivation of illegal crops like poppy illegally in order to make huge profits. To prevent this, the government should emphasize the cultivation of cash crops such as yongchak (parkia speciosa), cardamom, tea, coffee, black pepper, etc., as these crops are in high demand in the international and domestic market. On the other hand, this can reduce the environmental destruction that follows after short-term zoom cropping. In the flat areas, the main crops are also coarse grains, which are vulnerable to low returns. Farmers need to diversify into growing cash crops like black rice, medicinal plants, oilseeds, mushrooms, etc. In addition, farmers should be involved in non-agricultural sectors where both the agricultural and non-agricultural sectors can fit into the supply and demand schedule for their inputs and outputs. One of the institutional rigidities faced by farmers is asymmetric information about technological development in the agricultural sector. Krishi Vigyan Kendras (KVK) was instituted in all districts of India to fill the information gap between farmers and agricultural scientists. However, their works have been found confined to laboratories only and their insights are not in the realm of farmers' knowledge. The government should formulate policies for the KVKs so that they are available to farmers at least once a week in alternative blocks. Another institutional rigidity that we are witnessing is the financial inaccessibility of farmers to existing financial institutions (banks). In India, banks are found to release funds for the manufacturing and service sectors, but not for the agricultural sector. Too many official procedures and rigid financial guarantees make farmers inaccessible to banks. Therefore, banks should be advised to conduct a survey on the constructive environment in which farmers must access and repay loans on time. Another important institutional rigidity is the lack of marketing institutions such as farms and marketing agents that can trade such agricultural products. The government must invite local and non-local farms that can link farmers with consumers at the price determined by the market rate. The government must also have policies such as the Minimum Support Price and the construction of Cold Storage Rooms so that various types of agricultural products can be available during their low season. The last major institutional rigidity is the inability of the government to constitute a comprehensive body comprising the farmers' body mentioned above, financial institutes, KVK, marketing farms and government-funded research institutes. If the integral body works with mutual exchange of work with all the institutional constituents, the dream of ""Double Farmer's Income"" can be achieved. May this article draw the attention of the Ministry of Agriculture in fulfilling its ambition.",0

He notes that there has been progress in increasing access to education in Pakistan, with the number of children out of school falling from 25 million to 22 million according to government data. However, much remains to be done. Without compromising access to school, the focus should be on improving quality. The budget allocation for education is now 3.02% of GDP, compared to 2.83% last year, but still below target. The negative side of the situation is that 19% of children between the ages of 6 and 16 still do not attend school. The remaining 81% who are enrolled in the 6-16 age bracket are not learning much either. The seventh report of the ASER survey also highlighted, based on past trends, that children enrolled in private schools perform better compared to those studying in public schools. The number of children out of school should be a matter of concern for the entire nation and especially for the federal and provincial governments. It is quite obvious that poverty is the main cause keeping children out of school and forcing them to work to help supplement their families' income. The problem can be largely addressed by significantly increasing the number of public schools. Public schools charge little or nothing, but they are not enough to meet the needs of the growing population. The distance factor and the implication of unbearable travel costs also prevent parents from sending their children to school. Private schools have proliferated in both urban and rural areas and cater to the needs of the middle and upper income segments of society, but poor families cannot afford to have their children admitted to these schools. Their owners must also realize that they have social and national obligations and offer a percentage of total admissions to students from the poorest families of the poor for free. There are also issues of facilities, qualifications of teaching staff and the quality of education provided, and the government should at least provide training facilities for all teachers, including those employed in private schools.",0
