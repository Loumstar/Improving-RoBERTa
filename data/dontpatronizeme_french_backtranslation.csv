But their plan was not to be. Captured and detained by the Yemeni authorities, the approximately 600 men are now awaiting deportation, prevented from leaving their makeshift prison by armed soldiers. Conditions at the warehouse are becoming increasingly desperate. For several days, the authorities have stopped distributing food and essential supplies. “I came from Djibouti to work. They gave us small amounts of food. If there is no food, we will die,” said one migrant who declined to be named. ""If there is no solution, they will deport us to our countries or get us out of here,"" the man added. Yemen, the poorest country on the Arabian Peninsula, has long been a transit point for migrants and refugees from East Africa, many of whom are fleeing hunger and violence.

Hundreds of people drown each year during this perilous sea journey, and those who do face multiple risks, including death. by ""aggression, extortion and abuse by criminal networks, as well as the dangers arising from the war in Yemen itself"", according to UNHCR, the UN refugee agency. Despite these dangers, the number of migrants crossing the Gulf of Aden and the Red Sea to Yemen has steadily increased, from 92,000 in 2015 to 117,000 in 2016, according to UNHCR. Khaled al-Elwany, a local official who until recently oversaw the deportation of migrants to their home countries, says up to 15,000 migrants are stopped at checkpoints in the city each month. Elwany says he was fired by the Interior Ministry for refusing to cooperate with a plan to relocate the center to a neighboring province and after authorities cut off food supplies. A ministry official told Reuters the purpose of the move to a new facility was to improve conditions for migrants while awaiting deportation. Saudi Arabia and a coalition of mostly Gulf Arab allies are fighting to restore Yemen's government-in-exile to power and roll back the Iran-aligned Houthi movement. While the government nominally controls Aden and other southern regions, a budget crisis and rivalries with local armed groups mean that its officials mostly reside abroad.

7419,@@23830603,vulnerable,in,"Dr Mayengbam Lalit Singh Recently, the Honorable Prime Minister of India launched a program called “Double Farmers' Income” to improve the welfare of a larger portion of Indians. The big questions people feel are (i) How could this be possible in a short time? And (ii) is it an elusive doctrine to sweep the vote bank of millions of farmers for the next legislative elections in 2019? Across India (except a few states), so many rigidities need to be resolved in order to increase the real income of farmers. These rigidities are characterized by infrastructures, structures and institutions. This article focuses on these rigidities only for Manipur which lags behind many Indian states. When it comes to infrastructure (inputs), the state finds itself backward among the backward states of India. In reviewing water infrastructure, the state has underutilized water resources despite abundant availability. For crops in the Kharif season, farmers depend on rainwater since the state is under the SE monsoon map. However, during the Rabi and Zayed seasons, the state has witnessed water scarcity. In order to curb this shortage, the government needs the construction of several control dams and the digging of boreholes in these small streams that cross the plains. During the high season, there is always a shortage of fertilizers and pesticides due to landslides on national roads. The organic farming revolution will reduce reliance on chemical fertilizers since the state has a high potential for the production of organic fertilizers and pesticides. During the post-harvest period, the state must build cold stores so that perishable crops can be stored for the off-seasons of agriculture. As far as financial support for agriculture is concerned, the banks are not integrated with the farmers. Moreover, the state government does not organize crop insurance schemes to compensate for losses due to natural calamities. My previous article on “Fundraising the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA) with Crop and Livestock Insurance in India” postulates the model on how to compensate for the loss. The second rigid character of agriculture is that there has been no structural change over the decades. Agriculture in Manipur focuses on the production of coarse grains only which are characterized by immediate consumption. In this era of globalization, agriculture should have a close introspection of the demand and supply pattern of consumers across the world. Especially in hilly areas, the cultivation of coarse grains serves only to satisfy local consumption and not to generate profits. Farmers today report illegally growing illegal crops such as poppy in order to make huge profits. In order to avoid this, the government should emphasize the cultivation of cash crops such as yongchak (parkia speciosa), cardamom, tea, coffee, black pepper, etc. as these crops are in high demand on the international and domestic market. On the other hand, it can reduce the environmental destruction that is tracked after a short period of zoom cultivation. In lowland areas, the main crops are also coarse grains which are vulnerable to low profit. Farmers need to diversify their cash crops such as black rice, medicinal plants, oilseeds, mushrooms, etc. Additionally, farmers should engage in non-agricultural sectors where both agricultural and non-agricultural sectors can be integrated into the supply and demand calendar for their inputs and outputs. One of the institutional rigidities faced by farmers is asymmetric information about technological development in the agricultural sector. Krishi Vigyan Kendras (KVKs) have been instituted in all districts of India to bridge the information gap between farmers and agronomists. However, their work has been found to be confined to laboratories alone and their skills hardly fall within the realm of farmers' knowledge. The government should set policies for KVKs so that they are available to farmers at least once a week on alternate blocks. Another institutional rigidity we are witnessing is the financial inaccessibility of farmers to existing financial institutions (banks). In India, banks release funds for the manufacturing and service sectors, but not for the agricultural sector. Too many official procedures and rigid financial guarantees create farmers' inaccessibility to banks. Banks should therefore be advised to investigate the constructive environment in which farmers should adhere and repay loans on time. Another important institutional rigidity is the lack of marketing institutions such as marketing farms and agents who can sell these agricultural products. The government should invite local and non-local farms that can link farmers to consumers at a price determined by the market rate. The government should also have policies such as the minimum support price and the construction of cold stores so that various types of agricultural products can be available during their off season. The last most important institutional rigidity is the inability of the government to constitute an integral body which includes the body of farmers, financial institutes, KVKs, marketing farms and the government-funded research institutes mentioned above. If the integral body functions with a mutual exchange of functioning with all institutional constituents, the dream of “doubling farmers' income” can be realized. That this article can draw the attention of the Ministry of Agriculture to the realization of its ambition.",0

It notes that progress has been made in improving access to education in Pakistan, with the number of out-of-school children falling from 25 million to 22 million according to government data. However , there is still much to do . Without compromising access to school, the focus should be on improving quality. The budget allocation to education is now 3.02% of GDP, down from 2.83% last year, but still below target. The other side of the coin is that 19% of children aged 6 to 16 are still out of school. The remaining 81% who are enrolled in the 6-16 age group do not learn much either. ASER's seventh survey report also pointed out, in line with past trends, that children enrolled in private schools do better than those studying in public schools. The number of out-of-school children should be a source of concern for the whole nation and especially for the federal and provincial governments. It is quite evident that poverty is the main cause that keeps children away from schools and forces them to work to help supplement their families' incomes. The problem can be solved to a large extent if the number of public schools is increased significantly. Public schools charge little or no fees, but this is not enough to meet the needs of a growing population. The distance factor and the implication of unbearable travel costs also prohibit parents from sending their children to school. Private schools have proliferated in both urban and rural areas and cater to the needs of middle and high income segments of society, but poor families cannot afford to enroll their children in these schools. Their owners must also realize that they also have social and national obligations and offer a certain percentage of total admissions for free to students from the poorest of the poor families.
